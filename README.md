# FraudShield
FraudShield is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or genuine. It analyzes customer, vehicle and claim details using trained ML models to help insurers reduce fraud, save costs and improve decision-making. 

## Problem Statement

Insurance companies lose billions every year due to fraudulent claims. Manual verification is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically assess risk and flag suspicious claims early in the process.

Fraud Shield uses a machine learning model trained on historical insurance data to:
- Analyze user-provided claim details.
- Predict the likelihood of fraud.
- Provide an instant risk classification with explanation.
- Offer a clean and intuitive web interface for real-time usage.
